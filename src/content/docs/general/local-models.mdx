Summit AI Notes lets you run AI models directly on your Mac. This guide helps you understand the options and choose the right model for your workflow.

## How Model Selection Works

When you open Settings → AI Provider and select **Local**, you'll see a list of available models. Each model shows:

- **Quality levels** (Base, Med, High) - Choose based on your Mac's capabilities
- **Size** - How much disk space the model needs
- **RAM** - Memory required to run the model
- **Speed** - How fast the model generates summaries (tokens per second)
- **License** - The model's usage terms

## Choosing a Quality Level

Each model offers up to three quality levels:

| Level | What It Means | Best For |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Base** | Smaller file, faster speed, uses less RAM | Macs with 8GB RAM, quick daily summaries |
| **Med** | Balanced size and quality | Most users, good everyday choice |
| **High** | Largest file, best quality, needs more RAM | Macs with 16GB+ RAM, important meetings |

**Start with Med** - it works well for most users. If summaries feel slow or your Mac struggles, try Base. If you have a powerful Mac and want the best quality, try High.

## Choosing a Model

Different models have different strengths. Here's what we offer:

### Granite 4.0 Micro
- **Good for**: Fast summaries, lower-end hardware
- **Languages**: Excellent multilingual support (10+ languages)
- **RAM needed**: ~3.5GB

### Ministral 3 (8B and 14B)
- **Good for**: High-quality multilingual summaries
- **Languages**: Strong multilingual capabilities
- **8B version**: Good balance of speed and quality
- **14B version**: Better quality, needs more RAM (~10-16GB)

### Openai Gpt Oss 20B
- **Good for**: Best quality summaries
- **Needs**: 32GB RAM recommended, 24GB minimum
- **Note**: Slower but produces excellent results

### Qwen3 8B
- **Good for**: Reliable everyday use
- **Languages**: Excellent for English and Chinese
- **RAM needed**: ~8GB

## Quick Recommendations

**Mac with 8GB RAM:**
- Granite 4.0 Micro (Base) or Ministral 3 8B (Base)

**Mac with 16GB RAM:**
- Ministral 3 8B (Med or High) or Ministral 3 14B (Base)

**Mac with 32GB+ RAM:**
- Openai Gpt Oss 20B (High) or Ministral 3 14B (High)

## What About Quality Levels? (Technical Details)

Behind the scenes, Base/Med/High correspond to different "quantization" levels - a technical term for how the model is compressed to fit on your device.

Think of it like image quality settings:
- **High** = Full resolution photo (best quality, largest file)
- **Med** = Compressed photo (still looks great, smaller file)
- **Base** = Thumbnail (good enough for most uses, smallest file)

The model itself stays the same - quantization just affects how much detail is preserved in the compression. Higher quality levels produce slightly better summaries but need more RAM and storage.

You don't need to worry about the technical details. Just pick a quality level that matches your Mac's capabilities, and Summit handles the rest.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Check the RAM indicator** - Make sure your Mac has enough memory for your chosen model
2. **Try different models** - Each model has a slightly different "style" of summarizing
3. **Match quality to importance** - Use Base for quick daily meetings, High for important ones
4. **Close other apps** - Free up RAM when generating summaries for better performance
5. **Batch process if needed** - If you have limited RAM and back-to-back meetings, disable auto-processing and summarize everything at once later. See [Batch Processing for Limited RAM](/docs/setup/local-ai#batch-processing-for-limited-ram).

## Switching Models

You can keep multiple models downloaded and switch between them:

1. Go to Settings → AI Provider → Local
2. Click **Use Model** on any downloaded model
3. The active model shows a green "Active" badge

This lets you experiment to find what works best for your meetings.
