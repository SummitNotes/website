# Cloud Provider Setup Guide

This guide covers setting up cloud-based LLM providers for Summit AI Notes. Cloud providers offer excellent quality and don't require powerful hardware, but they do send transcription text to external servers.

## Privacy Reminder

When using cloud LLM providers:
- ✓ **Audio recordings** stay on your device (never uploaded)
- ✓ **Local transcription** happens on your Mac
- ⚠️ **Transcription text** is sent to the provider for summarization
- ⚠️ **Summaries** are generated by the cloud service

> If you need 100% privacy, use [LM Studio](/docs/setup/lmstudio) for local processing instead.

## Supported Cloud Providers

- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo)
- **Anthropic Claude** (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- **Google Gemini** (Pro, Flash)

---

## OpenAI Setup

OpenAI provides GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models, known for excellent quality and reliability.

### Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Click **Sign Up** (or **Log In** if you have an account)
3. Complete the registration process
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Add Payment Method

OpenAI requires a payment method for API access:

1. Go to [Settings → Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
2. Click **Add payment method**
3. Enter your credit/debit card information
4. Set up **Usage Limits** (recommended: $10-20/month for moderate use)

> **Cost Control**: Setting usage limits prevents unexpected charges. You'll receive alerts when approaching limits.

### Step 3: Generate an API Key

1. Go to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Click **Create new secret key**
3. Give it a name: `Summit AI Notes - Meeting Summaries`
4. Set permissions: **All** (or at minimum: `model.read` and `completions.create`)
5. Click **Create secret key**
6. **Important**: Copy the key immediately (you won't see it again)
7. Store it securely (don't share it or commit to version control)

### Step 4: Configure Summit AI Notes

1. Open **Summit AI Notes**
2. Go to **Summit AI Notes** → **Settings** (`⌘,`)
3. Navigate to the **LLM** tab
4. Select **OpenAI** from the provider dropdown
5. Paste your API key in the **API Key** field
6. Click "Refresh Models" and select a preferred model
7. Model is saved automatically

### Recommended Models

| Model | Best For | Estimated Cost/Meeting |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| GPT-4 Turbo | Maximum quality, complex analysis | $0.02-0.05 |
| GPT-4 | High quality, reliability | $0.05-0.10 |

> **Note**: Costs vary based on meeting length and transcription size.

### Troubleshooting OpenAI

**"Invalid API Key"**
- Verify you copied the entire key (starts with `sk-`)
- Check for extra spaces before/after the key
- Ensure the key hasn't been revoked in the OpenAI dashboard

**"Quota Exceeded"**
- Check your billing page for usage limits
- Add credits or increase usage limits
- Wait for monthly quota reset (if using free tier)

**"Rate Limit Exceeded"**
- You're sending requests too quickly
- Wait 20-30 seconds and try again

## Comparing Cloud Providers

| Feature | OpenAI | Anthropic Claude | Google Gemini |
|---------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Quality** | Excellent | Excellent | Very Good |
| **Speed** | Fast | Fast | Very Fast |
| **Cost** | Medium | Medium | Low |

| **Best For** | Reliability | Long content | Budget users |

## Switching Between Providers

You can change providers anytime:

1. Go to **Summit AI Notes** → **Settings** → **LLM**
2. Select a different provider from the dropdown
3. Enter the API key for that provider
4. Test the connection
5. Save

Your existing summaries remain unchanged. New summaries will use the new provider.

## Cost Management Tips

### Monitor Your Usage

**OpenAI**:
- Check [Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage) regularly
- Set up usage limit alerts

**Anthropic**:
- Check credit balance in [Billing Settings](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing)
- Add credits before running out

**Google**:
- Monitor usage in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
- Track requests in AI Studio

### Reduce Costs

1. **Use Faster Models**: GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude Haiku, Gemini Flash
2. **Summarize Less Frequently**: Only summarize important meetings
3. **Shorter Meetings**: Keep recordings focused and concise
4. **Batch Processing**: Summarize multiple meetings at once
5. **Switch to Local**: Use [LM Studio](/docs/setup/lmstudio) for unlimited free summaries

## Security Best Practices

### Protect Your API Keys

- ✓ Store keys in Summit AI Notes's secure settings (uses macOS Keychain)
- ✓ Never commit keys to git repositories
- ✓ Don't share keys in screenshots or support tickets
- ✓ Rotate keys every 3-6 months
- ✗ Don't hardcode keys in scripts

### Monitor for Suspicious Activity

1. Check your API usage dashboards regularly
2. Look for unexpected spikes in usage
3. Revoke and regenerate keys if compromised
4. Set up usage alerts

## Backup Strategy

It's wise to configure multiple providers:

1. **Primary**: Your preferred provider (e.g., Gemini for cost)
2. **Backup**: Another provider (e.g., OpenAI for reliability)
3. **Privacy**: LM Studio for sensitive meetings

This ensures you can always generate summaries even if one provider has issues.

## Privacy Considerations

### What Gets Sent to Cloud Providers

**Sent**:
- Meeting transcription text
- Your summary generation request
- Model configuration (temperature, etc.)

**NOT Sent**:
- Audio recordings
- Participant names (unless in transcription)
- Meeting metadata
- Your Summit AI Notes database

### GDPR and Compliance

**OpenAI**: GDPR compliant, data processed in US/EU
**Anthropic**: GDPR compliant, data processed in US
**Google**: GDPR compliant, data processed globally

Check each provider's privacy policy for details:
- [OpenAI Privacy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
- [Anthropic Privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- [Google AI Privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## When to Use Cloud vs Local

### Use Cloud LLMs When:
- You need maximum quality summaries
- Your Mac has limited RAM/CPU
- You process many meetings quickly
- Cost is not a primary concern

### Use Local LLMs When:
- Privacy is critical (NDA, confidential meetings)
- You want zero ongoing costs
- You have a powerful Mac (M2 Pro or better)
- You work offline frequently

See the [LM Studio Setup Guide](/docs/setup/lmstudio) for local processing.

## Next Steps

- [Learn about LLM configuration options](/docs/settings/llm)
- [Set up LM Studio for privacy](/docs/setup/lmstudio)
- [Customize summary templates](/docs/guides/custom-summaries) (coming soon)
