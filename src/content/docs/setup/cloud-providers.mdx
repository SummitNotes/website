## Overview

Summit AI Notes can connect to remote AI services using the "Remote (Cloud or Self-Hosted)" provider type. This includes both professional cloud services and your own self-hosted AI servers. Your audio recordings always stay on your computer - only the text transcription is sent for summarization.

**This guide covers:**
- **Cloud Providers** - Professional AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)
- **Self-Hosted Servers** - Your own AI server (LM Studio, Ollama, etc.)

**Supported options:**
- OpenAI (ChatGPT) - Reliable and high-quality cloud service
- Anthropic (Claude) - Excellent at long conversations (cloud)
- Google Gemini - Generous free tier (cloud)
- Other providers - Any OpenAI-compatible service including:
  - Self-hosted: LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM
  - Alternative clouds: Groq, Together AI, Perplexity

> **Note:** If you want AI that runs directly inside Summit AI Notes (no external software), see the [Local AI Setup](/docs/setup/local-ai) guide instead.

## Self-Hosted & Alternative Providers

### Using Other Providers

Summit AI Notes works with any service that uses OpenAI's API format. This includes:

**Self-hosted solutions (runs on your Mac/server):**
- LM Studio - Easy GUI, good for beginners
- Ollama - Command line, very efficient
- vLLM - Advanced, maximum performance

**Alternative cloud providers:**
- Groq - Very fast inference
- Together AI - Good pricing
- Perplexity - Search-augmented responses
- Corporate AI gateways - Your organization's AI service

### Setup for Other Providers

1. In Settings → LLM, select "Other" from the provider dropdown
2. Enter your Base URL (examples below)
3. Enter your API key (if required)
4. Try clicking "Refresh Models" - it might auto-detect available models
5. If that doesn't work, manually type your model name

**Common Base URLs:**
- Ollama: `http://localhost:11434/v1`
- LM Studio: `http://localhost:1234/v1`
- Groq: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`
- Together AI: `https://api.together.xyz/v1`

**Finding your model name:** Try searching Google for:
- "[Your provider name] OpenAI compatible models"
- "[Your provider name] available models list"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "API key is required"

**Problem:** You haven't entered an API key
**Solution:** Paste your API key in the settings field. Make sure there are no extra spaces.

### "Failed to fetch models"

**Problem:** The provider doesn't support automatic model detection (common with self-hosted servers)
**Solution:** This is normal. Just type your model name directly in the text field instead of using the dropdown.

### "Base URL is required for custom provider"

**Problem:** You selected "Other" but didn't enter a server address
**Solution:** Enter your server's URL. It usually ends with /v1 (e.g., `http://localhost:11434/v1`)

### Summaries aren't generating

Possible causes:
- **No credits:** Check your provider's dashboard to make sure you have available credits/quota
- **Invalid model name:** Double-check the model name spelling matches your provider's documentation
- **Rate limits:** You might have hit your provider's usage limits - wait a few minutes and try again

### Error when trying to connect

If you see an error code:
- **401 - Unauthorized:** Your API key is incorrect or expired
- **403 - Forbidden:** You don't have access (usually means insufficient credits)
- **404 - Not Found:** The model name is wrong or doesn't exist
- **429 - Too Many Requests:** You've hit rate limits - wait a bit or upgrade your plan
- **500 - Server Error:** The provider is having issues - try again in a few minutes

## Managing Costs

### Monitor Your Usage

Check your spending regularly:
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage
- Google: https://console.cloud.google.com

### Save Money

1. Use cheaper models for routine meetings (gpt-3.5-turbo, claude-haiku, gemini-flash)
2. Use premium models only for important meetings (gpt-4, claude-opus)
3. Set spending limits in your provider's dashboard
4. Switch to local models for zero cost (see Local Models documentation)

### Typical Costs

These are rough estimates for a 30-minute meeting:
- Budget models: $0.002-0.01 per meeting
- Standard models: $0.01-0.05 per meeting
- Premium models: $0.05-0.15 per meeting

## Privacy & Security

### What Gets Sent to the Cloud?

- ✅ **Sent:** Text transcription (to generate summary)
- ❌ **Never sent:** Audio recordings (transcription happens locally on your Mac)

### Your Data

- The summary is generated by the cloud provider and sent back to your Mac
- Everything is stored locally in your Summit AI Notes database
- Different providers have different data retention policies - check their privacy policies

### Keeping Your API Key Safe

- API keys are stored in your Mac's secure Keychain
- Never share your API key with others
- Rotate your keys every few months
- If you think your key was exposed, delete it and create a new one immediately

---

## Switching Providers

Want to try a different provider? You can switch anytime:

1. Go to Settings → LLM
2. Select a different provider
3. Enter the new API key
4. Choose a model

Your existing summaries won't change - only new recordings will use the new provider.

## Understanding the Options

### Remote vs. Local AI

**Remote AI (this guide)** includes both cloud and self-hosted:
- **Cloud providers:** Fast, high quality, costs money, requires internet, text sent to provider
- **Self-hosted:** Private, requires setup, free after initial setup, text stays local
- Both use the "Remote (Cloud or Self-Hosted)" setting in Summit

**Local AI** (different guide):
- AI runs directly inside Summit AI Notes
- No external software needed
- Completely private, works offline, free
- Slower but no setup complexity
- See [Local AI Setup](/docs/setup/local-ai) for this option

### Which Cloud Provider Should I Use?

Try Google Gemini first if you want to test things out for free.

Switch to OpenAI or Anthropic if you need:
- Consistently higher quality summaries
- Better handling of complex/technical discussions
- More reliable service

There's no wrong choice - you can always switch providers with a few clicks.
