# LM Studio Setup Guide

LM Studio enables you to run Large Language Models on your hardware, i.e. a dedicated server in the office or a gaming PC you might have, providing 100% privacy for your meeting summaries. This guide will walk you through the complete setup process.

## Why LM Studio?

- **Complete Privacy**: All processing happens on your device
- **No Ongoing Costs**: Free after initial setup
- **No Internet Required**: Works offline
- **Full Control**: Choose and customize your models
- **Flexible**: You can use your PC hardware to free up resources on your working laptop

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **For Mac** any mac with M1 or newer chip
- **For PC** any modern PC CPU
- **RAM/VRAM**: at least 16GB on mac, at least 8GB on PC GPU
- **Storage**: 10GB free space (for models)

### Recommended Specifications
- **Mac**: M2 Pro/Max or M4 Pro/Max
- **For PC** any modern PC CPU, GPU will do most of the work
- **RAM/VRAM**: 32GB or more on Mac, 10GB or more on PC GPU
- **Storage**: 50GB+ free space (for multiple models)

> **Note**: Larger models (70B parameters) require more RAM/VRAM.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download LM Studio

1. Visit [LM Studio's website](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Click **Download for Mac**
3. Wait for the download to complete (approximately 200MB)

### Step 2: Install LM Studio

1. [Follow the instructions on the website](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/app/basics)

### Step 3: Download a Language Model

LM Studio needs a language model to generate summaries. Good models to try: Qwen3 4B-8B, GPT-OSS-20B

#### How to Download a Model

1. In LM Studio, click the **Search** icon (magnifying glass)
2. In the search box, type: `gtp-oss-20b`
4. Click **Download**
5. Wait for the download to complete (5-15 minutes depending on connection)

> **What is Quantization?** Quantization reduces model size while maintaining quality. Q4_K_M is recommended for most users. Q8_0 is higher quality but larger. Q3_K_S is smaller but lower quality.

### Step 4: Start the Local Server

1. In LM Studio, click the **Local Server** tab (left sidebar)
2. At the top, select your downloaded model from the dropdown
3. Click **Start Server**
4. You should see: `Server running on http://localhost:1234`
5. **Important**: Keep LM Studio running while using Summit AI Notes

#### Server Configuration (Optional)

The default settings work for most users, but you can adjust:

- **Port**: Default is 1234 (change if needed)
- **CORS**: Leave enabled for Summit AI Notes to connect
- **Context Length**: 4096 tokens (increase for longer meetings)
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (lower = more focused, higher = more creative)

### Step 5: Configure Summit AI Notes to Use LM Studio

1. Open **Summit AI Notes**
2. Go to **Summit AI Notes** → **Settings** (or press `⌘,`)
3. Navigate to the **LLM** tab
4. Select **LM Studio** from the provider dropdown
5. Verify the endpoint is: `http://localhost:1234/v1`
6. Click **Test Connection**
7. If successful, you'll see: ✓ Connected to LM Studio
8. Click **Save Settings**

## Testing Your Setup

### Test the Connection

1. In Summit AI Notes's LLM settings, click **Test Connection**
2. You should see a success message
3. If it fails, check:
   - LM Studio is running
   - The local server is started
   - Port 1234 is not blocked by firewall

### Test with a Sample Meeting

1. Create a new recording in Summit AI Notes
2. Record a short test (30 seconds)
3. Stop the recording
4. Click **Generate Summary**
5. Watch the progress in Summit AI Notes (and optionally in LM Studio)
6. Verify the summary appears

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" Error

**Symptom**: Summit AI Notes can't connect to LM Studio

**Solutions**:
1. Verify LM Studio is running
2. Check the local server is started (green indicator)
3. Confirm the endpoint is `http://localhost:1234/v1`
4. Try restarting LM Studio
5. Check macOS firewall settings (System Settings → Network → Firewall)
6. Ensure no other app is using port 1234

### "Model Not Loaded" Error

**Symptom**: Server starts but shows no model loaded

**Solutions**:
1. In LM Studio's Local Server tab, select your model from the dropdown
2. Wait for the model to load (you'll see loading progress)
3. Once loaded, test connection from Summit AI Notes again

### Slow Summary Generation

**Symptom**: Summaries take a very long time to generate

**Solutions**:
1. **Use a Smaller Model**: Switch to Qwen3 1.7B
2. **Close Other Apps**: Free up RAM and CPU
3. **Reduce Context Length**: In LM Studio server settings, lower context to 2048
4. **Check Activity Monitor**: Ensure your Mac isn't thermal throttling
5. **Upgrade Hardware**: Consider cloud LLMs for older Macs

### Out of Memory Errors

**Symptom**: LM Studio crashes or shows memory errors

**Solutions**:
1. **Use Smaller Quantization**: Try Q4_K_M instead of Q8_0
2. **Switch to Smaller Model**: Use 7B instead of 70B
3. **Close Other Apps**: Free up RAM
4. **Restart Your Mac**: Clear memory leaks
5. **Consider Cloud LLMs**: If your Mac has limited RAM

### Summary Quality is Poor

**Symptom**: Generated summaries are incomplete or nonsensical

**Solutions**:
1. **Try a Larger Model**: Upgrade to GPT-OSS-20B (if your Mac supports it)
2. **Use Higher Quantization**: Try Q8_0 instead of Q4_K_M
3. **Adjust Temperature**: Lower to 0.5 in LM Studio server settings for more focused output
4. **Check Model**: Ensure you downloaded an "Instruct" or "Chat" variant
5. **Consider Cloud LLMs**: For maximum quality, try GPT-4 or Claude

## Updating Models

LM Studio models are updated periodically. To update:

1. Open LM Studio
2. Go to the **Search** tab
3. Search for your model
4. If an update is available, you'll see an **Update** button
5. Click **Update** to download the latest version
6. The old version will be replaced automatically

## Managing Storage

Models can take significant disk space. To manage:

1. In LM Studio, go to **My Models** tab
2. Review downloaded models and their sizes
3. Right-click models you don't use
4. Select **Delete** to free up space
5. You can always re-download models later

## Best Practices

1. **Keep LM Studio Running**: Start it when you boot your Mac for instant availability
2. **Download Multiple Models**: Have a fast model (7B) and quality model (70B) ready
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch Activity Monitor to understand resource usage
4. **Regular Updates**: Check for LM Studio and model updates monthly
5. **Backup Settings**: Note your preferred models and configurations

## Switching to Cloud LLMs Later

If you later decide to use cloud LLMs:

1. You can keep LM Studio installed for sensitive meetings
2. Simply switch providers in Summit AI Notes's LLM settings
3. No need to uninstall or remove models
4. You can switch back to local processing anytime
