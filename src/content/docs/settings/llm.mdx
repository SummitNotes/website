#### For LM Studio (Local)
1. Ensure LM Studio is running
2. The default local endpoint is `http://localhost:1234/v1`
3. No API key required

#### For Cloud Providers
1. Obtain an API key from your chosen provider:
   - [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Paste your API key in the designated field

## Privacy Considerations

### Local LLMs (LM Studio)
- **Audio**: Never leaves your device
- **Transcriptions**: Processed locally
- **Summaries**: Generated locally
- **Result**: Complete privacy

### Cloud LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- **Audio**: Never sent to cloud (only transcription text)
- **Transcriptions**: Sent to the LLM provider for summarization
- **Summaries**: Generated by cloud service
- **Result**: Transcription data shared with provider

> **Important**: When using cloud LLMs, only the transcription text is sent to the provider. Your audio recordings always stay on your device.

## Recommended Models

### For LM Studio (Local)
- **Llama 3.1 8B**: Good balance of speed and quality
- **Mistral 7B**: Fast, efficient for shorter meetings
- **Llama 3.1 70B**: Best quality (requires powerful Mac)

### For OpenAI
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Best quality, higher cost
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Fast, lower cost, good quality

### For Anthropic
- **Claude 3 Opus**: Highest quality
- **Claude 3 Sonnet**: Balanced quality and cost
- **Claude 3 Haiku**: Fastest, most economical

### For Google
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: High quality, good context window
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Fast, economical

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" Error

**For LM Studio:**
1. Verify LM Studio is running
2. Check that the local server is started (port 1234)
3. Ensure no firewall is blocking localhost connections
4. Try restarting LM Studio

**For Cloud Providers:**
1. Verify your API key is correct (no extra spaces)
2. Check your API key has sufficient quota/credits
3. Ensure your internet connection is stable
4. Verify the API key has the correct permissions

### "Slow Summary Generation"

**For LM Studio:**
- Try a smaller model (7B instead of 70B)
- Check your Mac's CPU/GPU usage
- Ensure sufficient RAM is available
- Consider upgrading your hardware or using cloud LLMs

**For Cloud Providers:**
- This is rare; usually indicates network issues
- Check your internet connection speed
- Try switching to a "faster" model variant

### "API Quota Exceeded"

**For Cloud Providers:**
1. Check your account balance/credits
2. Review your API usage limits
3. Add payment method or purchase more credits
4. Consider switching to LM Studio for unlimited local use
