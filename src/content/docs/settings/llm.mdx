Summit AI Notes uses AI to turn your meeting transcriptions into clear, actionable summaries. You have three options for running the AI: built-in local models, cloud providers, or your own self-hosted AI server.

## Quick Decision Guide

- ✅ No API keys or external software needed
- ✅ One-click setup
- ⚠️ Requires Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or newer)
- ⚠️ Slower than cloud AI
- ⚠️ Good quality (not the best)

**[👉 Set Up Local AI](/docs/setup/local-ai)**

---

### Cloud AI (Remote Services)
**Use professional AI services like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google**

---

### Self-Hosted AI (Your Own Server)
**Run AI on your own server using LM Studio, Ollama, or similar. Perfect if you have a gaming PC or if you want to setup a server for your team.**

- ✅ Complete privacy (your infrastructure)
- ✅ Zero ongoing costs (after setup)
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Full control over models
- ⚠️ Requires powerful Mac/PC for good performance
- ⚠️ 30+ minute setup time
