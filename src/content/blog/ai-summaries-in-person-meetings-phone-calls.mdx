Not every important conversation happens on Zoom.

The coffee shop meeting with a potential co-founder. The client lunch where the real decisions get made. The phone call while walking to grab coffee. The impromptu hallway conversation that changes everything.

These meetings matter. Often more than the scheduled video calls.

But if you use a cloud meeting notetaker, you're out of luck. Otter, Fireflies, and their competitors are built for one thing: joining video calls as a bot participant. No video call, no notes.

## The offline meeting gap

Think about how many important conversations happen outside of scheduled calls:

- **Sales calls from your phone.** You're walking, driving, or at a coffee shop. The prospect calls. You can't exactly ask them to switch to Zoom so your bot can join.

- **In-person meetings.** The investor meeting. The client pitch. The 1:1 with your manager. The conversations that matter most often happen face-to-face.

- **Impromptu discussions.** Someone pulls you aside after a meeting. A quick sync turns into a 45-minute strategy session. No calendar invite, no video link, no bot.

- **Phone calls, period.** Half of business communication still happens over regular phone calls. Cloud notetakers ignore this entirely.

For these conversations, most people fall back to handwritten notes. Or worse, they try to remember everything afterwards.

## Why cloud notetakers can't solve this

Cloud meeting bots have a fundamental architecture problem: they need to be a participant in a video call to capture audio.

The bot joins your Zoom or Google Meet. It receives the audio stream. It sends that audio to servers for transcription. This only works when there's a video call to join.

Some services offer mobile apps that can record phone calls, but with significant limitations:

- The audio goes to their servers for processing.
- Phone call recording has complex legal requirements in many jurisdictions.
- You need cellular data to upload the recording.
- The transcript isn't available until the upload and processing completes.

For in-person meetings, the options are even worse. You could place your phone on the table and use a voice recorder app, but then you're manually uploading files and hoping the cloud service can handle background noise.

## Local AI changes the equation

What if the transcription happened on your device?

No upload needed. No bot participant required. No waiting for cloud processing.

This is how Summit approaches the problem. Your Mac's microphone captures audio—from a phone call on speaker, from an in-person conversation, from any audio source. The transcription runs locally using models that live on your device.

When you're offline, everything still works. The AI doesn't need an internet connection to transcribe or summarize.

## How offline mode works

Summit's offline mode is simple:

1. **Start recording.** Click the menu bar icon or use a keyboard shortcut. No calendar event needed.

2. **Have your conversation.** Phone call, in-person meeting, voice memo to yourself—any audio your Mac can capture.

3. **Stop recording.** The local AI processes the audio and generates a transcript.

4. **Get your summary.** Same AI-powered notes you'd get from a video call: key points, action items, decisions made.

No data leaves your device. No internet required during or after the recording. The transcript and summary are ready in seconds, not minutes.

## Phone calls: the forgotten use case

If you take business calls on your phone, you've probably wished for automatic notes.

With Summit, you have options:

- **Speaker phone near your Mac.** Simple but effective. Put the call on speaker, and Summit captures both sides of the conversation.

- **Call from your Mac.** If you use FaceTime Audio or any VoIP app, Summit captures the system audio directly.

- **Bluetooth routing.** More technical, but you can route phone audio through your Mac with the right setup.

The point is: you're not limited to scheduled video calls. Any audio that reaches your Mac can become searchable, summarized meeting notes.

## In-person meetings: notes without the phone on the table

Recording in-person meetings always felt awkward. Put a phone on the table, hit record, and suddenly everyone's aware they're being recorded.

A laptop is different. It's already there. You're probably taking notes anyway.

With Summit running, you get:

- Automatic transcription of the conversation
- AI-generated summary and action items
- Searchable record of what was discussed
- No cloud upload, no third-party access

The recording stays local. You control who sees it, if anyone.

## When offline mode makes sense

Some scenarios where local recording beats cloud bots:

**Sensitive conversations.** Client discussions under NDA. Personnel issues. Competitive strategy. Some conversations shouldn't exist on third-party servers.

**No reliable internet.** Conference venues with overloaded WiFi. International travel. Rural client sites. Cloud services fail when connectivity fails.

**Spontaneous meetings.** No calendar invite means no bot invite. But the conversation still matters.

**Phone-heavy roles.** Sales, customer success, recruiting—if half your job happens on phone calls, cloud notetakers only cover half your work.

**Privacy-conscious counterparties.** Some clients refuse meetings with recording bots. A local-only approach removes that objection.

## The legal side

Quick note on recording laws, because this matters:

Recording conversations has legal requirements that vary by jurisdiction. Some places require all-party consent. Others only require one-party consent. Some have specific rules for phone calls versus in-person conversations.

Cloud or local, the legal requirements are the same. The difference is what happens to the recording after:

- With cloud services, the recording exists on servers you don't control, potentially forever.
- With local recording, you decide what happens to the file.

Know your local laws. Get consent when required. Local processing doesn't change the legal obligations—it just gives you more control over the data.

## What you lose without the cloud

To be fair, local-only has trade-offs:

- **No automatic joining.** You manually start and stop recording. There's no bot that shows up when your calendar event starts.

- **Device-dependent.** Your Mac needs to be present and running. You can't send an AI to a meeting you're not attending.

- **No real-time collaboration.** Cloud services can share live transcripts with teammates. Local keeps everything on your device.

For many use cases, these trade-offs are fine. For others, a cloud service makes sense.

The point isn't that local is always better. The point is that local is now possible—and for offline meetings, it's the only option that works.

## Getting started

Summit runs on Mac. The free tier covers transcription and basic summaries. Local AI processing works offline from day one.

For phone calls: put them on speaker near your Mac, or use a Mac-based calling app.

For in-person meetings: just have your laptop open as you normally would.

For any audio: if your Mac can hear it, Summit can transcribe it.

Your conversations deserve notes too—even when there's no video call to join.
