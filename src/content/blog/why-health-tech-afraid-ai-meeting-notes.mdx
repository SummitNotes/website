*And how on-device processing changes the equation*

## The Elephant in the Room

She's right to ask. While the rest of the tech world embraces AI-powered meeting tools, health tech remains cautious. And for good reason.

HIPAA violations carry fines up to **$1.5M per incident**. A single recorded conversation containing Protected Health Information (PHI) uploaded to a third-party cloud could trigger a breach notification, an OCR investigation, and a PR disaster.

So teams stick to manual notes. Or skip documentation entirely.

## It's Not Paranoia — It Already Happened

In late 2024, an Otter.ai bot attended a virtual meeting **in place of the doctor** who had been invited. While participants discussed private patient information, the unnoticed bot recorded everything.

The bot wasn't malicious. It was a calendar sync gone wrong. But the result was the same: **PHI captured by a third-party service without consent**.

This isn't an edge case. It's the inevitable result of cloud-based meeting bots that:

- Join calls automatically
- Upload audio to external servers
- Store transcripts indefinitely
- Process data in jurisdictions you don't control

## The Cloud Problem

Here's what happens when you use a typical AI meeting notes tool:

1. **Audio leaves your device** → uploaded to vendor's cloud
2. **Transcription happens on their servers** → they have access to your content
3. **Data stored in their infrastructure** → subject to their security practices, their jurisdiction, their subpoenas

For health tech, this creates an impossible compliance burden:

- You need a BAA (Business Associate Agreement) with every vendor
- You need to audit their SOC 2, HIPAA compliance, data residency
- You need to trust that their "delete" actually deletes
- You need to explain to your compliance team why patient discussions live on someone else's servers

Most teams decide it's not worth it. They go back to pen and paper.

## What If the Audio Never Left?

On-device processing flips the architecture:

1. **Audio captured locally** → never leaves your Mac
2. **Transcription runs on your hardware** → using local ML models
3. **Notes stay in your control** → no cloud uploads, no third-party access

There's nothing to breach because there's nothing to steal.

No BAA needed. No vendor audit required. No explaining to Legal why meeting audio is sitting in an AWS bucket in Virginia.

**Your notes. Your device. Your data.**

## The New Standard for Regulated Industries

Health tech isn't the only sector with this problem:

- **Legal teams** can't risk client privileged conversations in the cloud
- **Finance** faces SEC and FINRA scrutiny on communication records
- **Government contractors** have FedRAMP and ITAR concerns

On-device meeting notes aren't just a privacy feature — they're becoming a **compliance requirement**.
