If you use Obsidian, you know the pain: your meeting notes live somewhere else.

Otter keeps them in their cloud. Fireflies owns your transcripts. Granola... well, people have been [asking for markdown export](https://x.com/kavirkaycee) for months.

Meanwhile, your vault sits there, perfectly organized, waiting for the one type of knowledge that matters most: what people actually said in meetings.

## The Problem With Cloud Meeting Notes

Every cloud meeting notes app creates the same problem:

1. **Your notes are hostage.** Want to link a meeting to a project? Copy-paste. Want to search across meetings and notes? Two different apps.

2. **Privacy is someone else's promise.** Your transcripts live on their servers. Their privacy policy can change. Their security can fail. ([Ask Otter users about that.](/blog/otter-lawsuit-consent-liability))

3. **No backlinks, no graph.** The whole point of a PKM system is connections. Cloud silos don't connect to anything.

## Summit's Approach: Your Mac, Your Files

Summit records and transcribes everything on your Mac. No cloud. No upload. No meeting bot joining your calls.

And since version 1.7, Summit can **automatically export every meeting to markdown** — straight into your Obsidian vault.

## Setting Up Auto-Export

1. Open **Summit → Settings → Export**
2. Enable **Auto-export to Markdown**
3. Choose your vault's folder (e.g., `~/Documents/Vault/Meetings/`)
4. Done.

Every recording now creates a markdown file like:

```
Meetings/
├── 2026-02-10 - Weekly Standup.md
├── 2026-02-09 - Client Call.md
└── 2026-02-08 - 1:1 with Alex.md
```

## What You Get

Each exported file includes:

```markdown
---
title: Weekly Standup
date: 2026-02-10
duration: 45:23
participants:
  - Alex
  - Sarah
  - Mike
tags: [meeting, standup]
---

## The Obsidian Workflow

Now your meetings are first-class citizens in your vault:

**Link to projects:**
```markdown
Met with client about [[Project Alpha]]. 
See [[2026-02-10 - Client Call]] for details.
```

**Search everything:**
One search bar. All your notes. All your meetings.

**Build your graph:**
Watch connections form between meetings, people, projects, and ideas.

**Daily notes integration:**
```markdown
## Meetings Today
- [[2026-02-10 - Weekly Standup]]
- [[2026-02-10 - Client Call]]
```

## Privacy Stays Local

Here's what happens when you record a meeting with Summit:

1. Audio captured locally on your Mac
2. Transcription runs locally (Whisper models, no internet needed)
3. AI summary generated locally (or with your own API key)
4. Markdown exported to your local folder
5. Obsidian syncs however you want (iCloud, Syncthing, Git, or not at all)

At no point does your meeting audio or transcript leave your machine — unless you explicitly choose to sync your vault.

Compare that to cloud alternatives where your audio is uploaded, processed on their servers, stored indefinitely, and potentially used to train their models.

## For Obsidian Power Users

A few tips:

**Templates:** Create an Obsidian template for meeting follow-ups that links to the auto-exported file.

**Dataview queries:** Since exports include YAML frontmatter, you can query meetings:
```dataview
TABLE duration, participants
FROM "Meetings"
WHERE date >= date(2026-02-01)
SORT date DESC
```

**Tags:** Summit adds tags based on calendar event categories. Use them for filtering.

**Folder per project:** Set different export folders for different contexts if you organize by project.
