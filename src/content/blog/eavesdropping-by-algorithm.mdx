A bot joined a university faculty meeting this week. Nobody sent it. Nobody knew who did. It just appeared in the Zoom, recording everything.

That's not a bug. That's what these products are designed to do.

A law firm called it what it is: **eavesdropping by algorithm**.

## "Eavesdropping by Algorithm"

Babst Calland, a Pittsburgh-based law firm, published a briefing this month on the legal risks of AI meeting tools. Their phrasing cut through the usual PR language: AI meeting bots are, functionally, algorithmic eavesdropping systems.

Not surveillance. Not data collection. Eavesdropping.

The word choice matters. Eavesdropping has a specific legal meaning — listening to a conversation you're not a party to, without consent. When a bot joins your call on behalf of someone else, that's exactly what happens.

## The Faculty Zoom Incident

This week a bot crashed a university faculty meeting. The faculty didn't know who sent it. Nobody in the room had authorized it. The bot sat there, recording a private institutional conversation, until someone noticed and removed it.

The incident went viral — not because it was unprecedented, but because it made visible something that happens quietly every day. AI bots join calls that weren't meant for them. They record things that weren't meant to be recorded.

What made faculty meetings special? Nothing. That's the point.

The same thing happens in legal consultations, medical discussions, board meetings, therapy sessions. The only difference is most people don't check the participant list.

## Notion Just Entered the Room

This week Notion launched Meeting Notes — AI-powered meeting summaries built into their workspace.

This is validation. When a company like Notion dedicates product resources to meeting notes, it means the market is real and the problem is worth solving.

But Notion's approach is the cloud approach. Your meeting gets uploaded to their servers, processed by their AI, stored in their database. It works great — until there's a breach, a subpoena, or a regulatory change.

Notion entering the space is good for the problem. It's not a solution to the problem.

## The Architecture Is the Policy

Here's what most people miss: this isn't a settings problem. It's an architecture problem.

Meeting bots — whether from Otter, Fireflies, Fathom, Notion, or anyone else — share a fundamental design: audio leaves your device. It travels to company servers. It gets processed there. It gets stored there.

That architecture makes certain things impossible:
- You can't guarantee who has access to the recording
- You can't prevent it from being used to train models
- You can't protect it from a breach you didn't cause
- You can't stop it from appearing in a legal discovery process

"We take privacy seriously" is not an architecture. It's a promise — and promises expire.

## What On-Device Actually Means

Summit AI Notes transcribes your meetings entirely on your Mac. No audio upload. No cloud processing. No third-party servers.

When the meeting ends, the transcript is on your device. The audio is on your device. The summary is on your device.

A law firm can't subpoena your local files from us. We don't have them.
A breach at our company won't expose your recordings. We don't store them.
A bot can't join your meeting through our system. We don't have a bot.

This isn't a privacy feature. It's what the product does by default — because the alternative is what Babst Calland called eavesdropping by algorithm.
