Meetings used to be ephemeral. You said something, you took a few notes, and then the moment passed.

AI meeting notes change that. A single call can quietly produce a recording, a transcript, a summary, action items, and a searchable trail that lives far longer than the meeting itself.

That trail is the real product. And it is also the real risk.

If you work in legal, finance, healthcare, internal strategy, or any environment where trust is constrained, the question is not whether the summary is accurate.

The question is where the artifacts live, who can access them, and how long they stick around.

## How artifacts escape

Most exposures do not start with a sophisticated hack. They start with totally normal product mechanics.

A recording is saved to cloud storage. A link is emailed to attendees. That link lands in a calendar event. Someone forwards it in chat. Someone copies it into a doc. Now it is in five places, and nobody remembers which one is still accessible.

Google Meet is explicit about this flow. Recordings are saved to Drive, and an email with the recording link is sent, and the link is also added to the calendar event.

Once meeting artifacts exist as links, you get link sprawl. Even when the vendor has strong security, your risk is dominated by sharing surfaces.

## A real precedent: Zoom cloud recordings were discoverable

This is not theoretical. In 2020, reporting showed that thousands of Zoom cloud recordings could be found on the open web due to predictable naming and indexing.

This is the canonical precedent, not because it is about AI, but because it proves the mechanism.

Cloud meeting artifacts plus discoverability equals accidental exposure.

AI meeting notes multiply the number of artifacts. More artifacts means more chances for one to escape.

## The uncomfortable part: meeting notes become evidence

There is another risk that gets ignored in most product demos: retention and legal discovery.

If your summaries and transcripts live in systems like Microsoft 365, they can become part of formal eDiscovery workflows.

Microsoft Purview eDiscovery is designed to preserve, collect, review, and export content. It can place an eDiscovery hold. It can also collect cloud content shared via links.

Once content is held and collected, deleting it later stops being a reliable control. Your meeting notes are no longer just notes. They are part of corporate records.

## Teams and internal discoverability

Even inside a company, meeting artifacts can spread faster than you expect.

Microsoft documents that Teams meeting recordings are saved to OneDrive or SharePoint, and Microsoft 365 Search indexes them. They can also appear across surfaces like Shared with me, Recommended, and Recent.

This is what makes modern collaboration usable. But if your meetings are sensitive, usability is also the threat model.

## Frictionless sharing is a trade

Some products intentionally make sharing frictionless. That is great for collaboration. It is also the exact class of surface area that causes accidental exposure when used for sensitive meetings.

For example, Granola documentation describes link access modes for shared folders, including an Anyone with the link option that allows viewing in a web browser.

To be clear, Anyone with the link is not inherently bad. It is a reasonable option for many teams.

The point is that sensitive meetings need a different default.

## The architecture fix: local first, zero cloud

If you cannot send recordings through third party servers, most AI meeting tools become unusable.

And that is the core gap. The meetings where notes matter most are often the meetings where cloud recording is not allowed.

Summit is a zero cloud AI meeting note taker built for trust constrained environments.

## What Summit does differently

Summit is built around a simple constraint: sensitive audio should not be shipped to third party servers.

- Local first processing. Your meeting content stays on your device.
- Zero cloud by default. No vendor hosted transcript pages and no external share links as the normal path.
- Designed for sensitive meetings. Legal, internal, regulated, or simply trust constrained calls.
- Clear outputs. Notes focused on decisions and action items instead of raw transcript sprawl.

## If you must use cloud tools

If you are using cloud meeting assistants today, a few non negotiables.

Treat summaries and transcripts like confidential documents. Turn off broad link sharing where possible. Review defaults regularly. Set retention explicitly. Assume anything in a shared system can be exported.

Cloud tools can be secure. But security is not the same as control.

## Closing

AI meeting notes are incredibly useful. The danger is not AI.

The danger is making your most sensitive conversations durable, searchable, and shareable by default.

Privacy by promise is fragile. Privacy by architecture is durable.
