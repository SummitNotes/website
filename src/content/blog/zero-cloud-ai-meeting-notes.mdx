Meetings used to be ephemeral. You said something, you took a few notes, and then the moment passed.

AI meeting notes flip that. A single call can produce:

- a recording
- a transcript
- a summary
- action items
- searchable knowledge
- shareable links

That is not just productivity. That is a new data surface.

If you work in legal, finance, healthcare, internal strategy, or any environment where trust is constrained, the question is not "is the summary accurate".

The question is "where does this live, who can access it, and for how long".

## The pattern: artifacts escape through links

A lot of leaks do not start with a sophisticated hack. They start with ordinary product mechanics:

- a recording saved to cloud storage
- a link emailed to attendees
- a calendar event that keeps the link forever
- a document that gets forwarded once
- search and indexing that makes it easy to discover

Google Meet is explicit about this flow: recordings are saved to Drive, and an email with the recording link is sent to participants, and the link is added to the calendar event.

Once meeting artifacts exist as links, you now have link sprawl. People forward links. Links show up in chats. Links get copied into docs. Links become "shared with me".

Even if the vendor has strong security, your risk is now dominated by sharing surfaces.

## A real precedent: Zoom cloud recordings were discoverable

In 2020, reporting showed that thousands of Zoom cloud recordings could be found on the open web due to predictable naming and indexing.

This is the canonical precedent. Not because it is "about AI". Because it proves the mechanism:

- cloud meeting artifacts
- discoverability
- accidental exposure

AI meeting notes multiply the number of artifacts. More artifacts means more chances for one to escape.

## The uncomfortable part: meeting notes become evidence

There is another risk that does not get discussed enough: retention and legal discovery.

If your meeting summaries and transcripts live in systems like Microsoft 365, they can become part of formal eDiscovery workflows.

Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium) is designed to preserve, collect, review, and export content. It can place an eDiscovery hold. It can also collect cloud content shared via links.

Once content is held and collected, "deleting it later" stops being a reliable control. Your meeting notes are no longer just notes. They are part of corporate records.

This is exactly the scenario people are pointing at when they say "lawyers will have a field day".

## Teams and internal discoverability

Even inside a company, meeting artifacts can spread faster than you expect.

Microsoft documents that Teams meeting recordings are saved to OneDrive or SharePoint, and Microsoft Search indexes them. They can also appear across surfaces like Shared with me, Recommended, and Recent.

This is not a criticism. It is what makes modern collaboration usable.

But if your meetings are sensitive, usability is also the threat model.

## Granola style sharing makes the tradeoff visible

Some products intentionally make sharing frictionless.

For example, Granola documentation describes link access modes for shared folders, including an "Anyone with the link" option that allows viewing in a web browser.

This is convenient. It is also exactly the class of surface area that causes accidental exposure when used for sensitive meetings.

To be clear, "anyone with the link" is not inherently bad. It is a reasonable option for many teams.

The point is that sensitive meetings need a different default.

## The architecture fix: local first, zero cloud

If you cannot send recordings through third party servers, most AI meeting tools become unusable.

And that is the core gap: the meetings where notes matter most are often the meetings where cloud recording is not allowed.

Summit is a zero cloud AI meeting note taker built for environments like:

- legal client calls
- internal strategy
- healthcare and sensitive conversations
- security and trust constrained organizations

The goal is simple: automate meeting notes without creating a new external "company brain".

Local first is not a marketing claim. It is an architectural constraint that changes the risk profile:

- no vendor hosted transcript pages
- no external share links by default
- smaller breach blast radius
- fewer retention and discovery surfaces

## A practical checklist if you must use cloud tools

If you are using cloud meeting assistants today, here are a few non negotiables:

1) treat meeting summaries and transcripts like confidential documents
2) turn off broad link sharing where possible
3) review default access settings regularly
4) set retention explicitly
5) assume anything in a shared system can be exported

Cloud tools can be secure. But security is not the same as control.

## Closing

AI meeting notes are incredibly useful. The danger is not "AI".

The danger is making your most sensitive conversations durable, searchable, and shareable by default.

Privacy by promise is fragile. Privacy by architecture is durable.
