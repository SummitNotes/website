Move over, "This meeting could have been an email."

The new office complaint is: "Who invited the AI notetaker?"

## The bot invasion

Every video call now has an uninvited guest. Sometimes two. Sometimes three.

You join a client call. There's a bot from Otter. A bot from Fireflies. And the host's company has its own internal recording bot. The participant count shows 8 people, but only 5 are human.

Austen Allred, founder of Lambda School, put it bluntly on X: meetings now have 2x participants as people actually attending.

This is not a productivity win. This is bot sprawl.

## The etiquette problem

When someone sends a bot to your meeting, what are they really saying?

One interpretation: "This meeting matters enough to record, but not enough for me to take my own notes."

Another interpretation: "I might not even watch this later, but I want the option."

The charitable interpretation: "I want to be fully present instead of frantically typing."

The reality is often more mundane. Once you sign up for these notetakers, they join all your meetings automatically. The person who invited the bot might not even know it's there.

MakeUseOf called this out directly: "The meeting wasn't important enough for you to spend your time on, so you're sending an AI bot in your place?"

## The trust problem nobody talks about

Here's a story that should make you pause.

Fireflies.ai, now valued at over $1 billion, started with a creative hack. Before their AI actually worked, the founders would manually dial into customer meetings as "Fred from Fireflies.ai."

They sat there silently. Took notes by hand. Sent the "AI-generated" notes 10 minutes later.

They did this for over 100 meetings.

The founders frame this as scrappy startup hustle. And maybe it was.

But flip the perspective. If you were in one of those early meetings, you thought you were being recorded by AI. Instead, a stranger was silently listening to your conversation and typing everything you said.

How would you feel about that?

This raises an uncomfortable question: when a bot joins your meeting, what's actually happening on the other end?

## The security problem

Gadi Evron, CEO of AI security company Knostic, co-authored a piece for Dark Reading titled "Take Note: Cyber-Risks With AI Notetakers."

The concerns are not hypothetical:

- Meeting transcripts contain sensitive information: strategy discussions, personnel issues, financial details, client conversations.
- These transcripts are stored on third-party servers you don't control.
- They're indexed, searchable, and often shared via links.
- They can be subpoenaed in legal discovery.
- A single breach at the notetaker company exposes thousands of organizations.

Your meeting was supposed to be ephemeral. Now it's a permanent record on someone else's server.

## The consent problem

Here's the part that makes people queasy.

When you join a meeting with a recording bot, you're often asked to consent. But consent to what, exactly?

- That your voice will be transcribed?
- That the transcript will be stored indefinitely?
- That it might be used to train AI models?
- That it could be shared with anyone who has the link?

Most consent prompts are a single "OK" button. The details are buried in terms of service that nobody reads.

Bloomberg's headline captured the mood: "AI Notetakers in Meetings Are Making Me Queasy."

## The alternative: notes without bots

The meeting bot model exists because cloud transcription requires a participant to capture audio. If you want AI notes in the cloud, something needs to be in the room recording.

But what if the AI runs on your device?

Summit takes a different approach. It captures audio locally, processes everything on your Mac, and generates meeting notes without ever sending your conversation to external servers.

No bot joins your call. No third party has your transcript. No link gets shared that you didn't create yourself.

This is what privacy-by-architecture looks like for meeting notes.

## When you can't avoid bots

If someone else invites a bot to your meeting, you have limited options:

1. **Ask them to disable it.** This is socially awkward but reasonable for sensitive discussions.
2. **Assume the meeting is recorded.** Adjust what you say accordingly.
3. **Request transcript deletion.** Most services offer this, though enforcement is murky.
4. **Leave the meeting.** The nuclear option, but sometimes appropriate.

For meetings you control:

- Use local-first tools that don't require bots.
- If you must use cloud tools, inform all participants explicitly.
- Set retention policies and actually enforce them.
- Treat transcripts like confidential documents, because they are.

## The bigger picture

Meeting bots are a symptom of a larger shift. We're making conversations searchable, shareable, and permanent by default.

Sometimes that's useful. Often it's unnecessary. Occasionally it's dangerous.

The question isn't whether AI meeting notes are good or bad. They're genuinely useful.

The question is whether the convenience is worth the trade-offs: the awkwardness, the privacy erosion, the security risks, and the fundamental change in how we communicate when we know everything is being recorded.

Maybe the answer is to stop inviting bots entirely.

Or maybe the answer is AI that doesn't need to join your meeting in the first place.
